                    <h1>Timed Essay</h1>
                    <p>
                        The timed essay was a two-part assignment in which I first needed to analyze some graphs and data and then write an essay supported by the data and my takeaways. The writing portion of this assignment was done with a time constraint.
                        In terms of 21st Century Skills, I believe that this assignment best targeted information skills. Being a good writer indeed helped with this assignment, but the most vital part was analyzing and interpreting all of the different data presented before the essay.
                        I am proud of how I did with this assignment because it reflects much of what I learned last year. I took both English and Statistics courses at the college last year, and this assignment combined elements I learned from both of those courses.

                    <h1>Botique Hotel</h1>
                    <p>
                        For this assignment, I was tasked to build the floor plan for a two-story boutique hotel. There were a multitude of requirements for this assignment, including the specific rooms, their placement, and size. Completing this assignment, I had to think carefully and critically, as changing even the slightest detail could have implications for the entire project. 
                        I am most proud of the improvisation I had to do to fit all the guest rooms in my design. There was a moment where I felt I might have to restart the assignment, but I had to think outside the box to make my design work.

                    <h1>Ocean Acidification Research Project</h1>
                    <p>
                        A two-part assignment that first involved a research paper about ocean acidification and identifying a potential solution for it, and then a recap of my research in the form of a presentation.
                        This assignment, especially the research paper, was difficult since it was not clear that the paper needed to be written in a specific scientific format until the day before the assignment was due. However, I was able to overcome this setback regardless.

                    <h1>Socratic Seminar</h1>
                    <p>
                        For the Socratic seminar assignment, I first had to generate what I thought were thought-provoking questions and discussion topics relating to early civilization or not relating to it at all. Then, I was put in a group of students who had all done the same, and we discussed our questions in a Socratic seminar.
                        In the past, I have done social seminars, but they were never very organized and felt forced. During this assignment, I learned what a proper socratic seminar should look like, and I believe I was able to demonstrate growth by only interrupting someone else once.
