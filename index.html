            <h1>Hi, I'm Casey</h1>
            <p>Born and raised in Maui, this is my first year at Kihei Charter, transferring in as a senior.
               Throughout the years, I've met some amazing people, accomplished things that others never 
               believed I was capable of, and fought so many battles, internal and external, to get to where I am today
               in my pursuit of becoming the best possible version of myself. Academically, I am working towards a career
               in the computer science field as a web developer. Currently, I am taking a gap year to both improve my craft
               as well as simply enjoy life before I enter college at Oregon State University.

                    <h1>9th Grade - Short Story</h1>
                    <p>
                        In my 9th grade English class, I was tasked with creating a 3-5 page short story. I decided to make my own spin-off story based on the world of the game Cyberpunk 2077. I recall investing a considerable amount of time and effort in this assignment, far more than any other assignment I undertook freshman year. I was commended for my use of descriptive language, and according to my  English teacher at the time, left her wanting more as a reader.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My 10th Grade U.S. History final was a multi-assignment project that pitted each student in the class and their chosen "American Hero" against each other. While everyone else was choosing individuals like George Washington and Ben Franklin, I made the focus of my project Keith Gill, the man who led a successful short squeeze of GameStop stock on the internet. I wrote a biography, debated my classmates, designed and 3D printed a physical element (diamond), and made a video presentation that was deemed superior to the work of my peers via majority vote, winning Keith Gill and me the American Heroes tournament.

                    <h1>11th Grade - Hypothesis Testing</h1>
                    <p>
                        In my Math 110 class at UHMC, I was tasked with making a hypothesis given a data set and mathematically proving or falsifying my null hypothesis. For this project, I took a data set of graduation rates across different ethnicities to test the stereotype that Asians perform better in school than other races. Applying what I learned about hypothesis testing from that class, I calculated a p-value and test statistic, then graphed my results on a t-distribution to find that I should reject my null hypothesis.

                    <p>
                        For my senior project, I applied my web development and coding skills to make a much-needed new modern website for KCS. My goal for the new website was not to do anything overly flashy and to make a clean, sleek, modern website from scratch. It took a lot of self-direction, discipline, and creative thinking to make a full commercial website and follow the guidelines and parameters given to me by the school administration. Within the next year, my website will be made the official KCS site usable by current and prospective students, staff, and parents.
